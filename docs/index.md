# Open & Reproducible workflows in Earth Observation

Many cloud-based solutions for workflows in EO are available to users today, but only few support reproducibility or comply with the [OGC FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability)](https://www.ogc.org/blog-article/how-ogc-contributes-to-fair-geospatial-data/) data principles.

This short tutorial demonstrates a solution that meets these requirements by executing an EO Application Package in a sample scenario. 

This documentation is a work in progress.
